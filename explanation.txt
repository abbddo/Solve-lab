                every other point on rod is w.r.t to  origin
            right : position of rightmost point of rod w.r.t to canvas

        methods (functions)
                .attach()
                    it attaches a point of the rod [imagePoint] to a point in the canvas [canvasPoint] both given by user
                has two parameters :
                    canvasPoint:
                        point on the canvas to which the rod is to be attached
                    imagePoint:
                        point on the rod which attaches to the canvasPoint

                rotate()
                    draws the rod at a point specified in previous function and at the angle given in this function
                has 2 parameters :
                    angle:
                        the angle to which the rod is to rotated
                    imagePoint:
                        the point of the rod abt which the rod is to be rotated
    Slider
        attributes:
            length
            breadth
            origin : has location of the centre of the slider w.r.t the canvas

                parameters
                    canvasPoint:
                        the point in the canvas to which the slider is to be attached
                    imagePoint
                        the point in the slider which attaches to the above mentioned point
            .rotate()
                draws the slider at the point specified above at an angle abt the given point
                parameters
                    angle:
                        the angle at which the slider is inclined
                    imagePoint:
                        the point about which the the inclination is drawn
IMPORTANT POINTS
    THE ROTATE FUNCTION DOESNT ROTATE THE OBJECT IS JUST DRAWS IT AT ANGLE IN EACH FRAME
    THE ROTATION IS DUE TO THE DIFFERANT ANGLES IN EACH FRAME

    THE ATTACH ONLY STORES THE VALUE IN THE OBJECT
    THE OBJECT IS NOT DRAWN TILL THE ROTATE IS CALLED
